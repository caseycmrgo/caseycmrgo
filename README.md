- 👋 Hi, I’m Casey Camargo.
- 
- 🐈 In my current role, I am focused on details and keeping things organized. My team members often come to me for help because I make it a point to find answers.
- I have built a reputation for myself as someone that you can rely on. I have also built a reputation as someone who is committed to learning.
- If there is a question or a problem that I don't know the answer to, I am determined to figure it out. Solving problems is just who I am.
- 
- 🌻 I have also been described as the light of the office because I brighten up the space. I always come in with a positve attitude. That is probably what
- I am most proud of. Making the week a little better for my team makes the job all the more worth it.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a data analyst. I truly feel that my passion for organization and digging through information would align perfectly in this role.
-     
- 🌱 Outside of my current job, I’m currently improving my skills with SQl, Tableau, R, and Power Bi. While I do this I am adding projects to my portfolio.
