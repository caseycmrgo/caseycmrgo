**look into how to do markdowns 

Basics:

--SQL stands for structured query language. This language allows data analysts to work with data bases. It can handle huge amounts of data. 

--To pull up a table from a data set

Select *
from datasetname.tablename

--to filter data use WHERE

select *
from datasetname.tablename
where column2 = value

-- to sort data use ORDER BY

Select *
from datasetname.tablename
Order by column

-automatically ordered by ascending, can order by descending by using DESC

--to insert info into a table

insert into datasetname.tablename
(column1, column2, column3)
values (value1, value2, value3) 

--to update info in a table

update dataset.tablename
set column1 = newvalue
where = condition

--to create a new table (to save our modified table we can save it as a new table) 

create table dataset.newtablename as
select column1,
column2
from dataset.oldtablename

-you can add the where clause to get more specific if need be 

Cleaning in SQL:

-- to avoid duplicates use DISTINCT

Select
Distinct column1
from datasetname.tablename
